# UpGoaled üèÅ
An accountability platform to reach your goals and take responsibility for your progress.

## introduction  
UpGoaled, a decentralised web application for goal tracking and accomplishment. On our secure platform, users pledge tokens to set their goals. If a goal isn't met, the tokens are forfeited and redistributed amongst the users who successfully achieve their goals. This unique gamification adds a competitive edge and fosters collective responsibility. Thus, UpGoaled transcends traditional goal-tracking platforms, offering a rewarding ecosystem that motivates users to strive for their objectives, creating a community with aligned incentives and the gamification of activities

## Key Features
1. User Management: Users can create an account and manage their personal goals.

2. Goal Selection and Management: Users can join goals events, and track their progress. 

3. Staking: Users can pledge funds towards their goals as a commitment. If they complete the goal, they will get their pledged funds back. If they fail to complete the goal, they will not receive the funds they staked.

4. Goal Pools: Users will be able to select from diffrent pools to which they can allocate their pledged funds. This allows for better organization and management of the user's goals and funds.

5. Community Participation: Users can join a community of other users who share the same goals, fostering a sense of camaraderie and mutual support.

6. Transparent and Secure: The platform is built using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and security in all transactions.

7. Web3 Integration: The platform seamlessly works with Web3 wallets such as MetaMask, allowing users to securely sign transactions and interact with the app using their wallet.
